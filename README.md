# hello-world
A place to store ideas, resources, or share discussions

Hello world! My name is Ryan Bolton, and I am currently a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering with an interest in Bioinformatics. I also am pursuing a minor in Computer Science, and as such am getting a chance to learn multiple programming languages, such as Python, C++, Java/HTML, and more. 

I have added a few repositories for code done in my Intro to Programming and Intermediate Programming courses, in a hopes that it will help someone in some way. 

I have also created a respository for research code, which is a Pandas Data Sorter I built using Python that utilizes user-input to sort and display large csv or excel files of data. The file used for the research was specifically built to handle a small dataset of around 60,000 rows x 18 columns, but it contains functions written to parse larger files into chunks to sort datasets with millions of rows if necessary. 

Lastly I have created a sidework repository for fun little programs I have found or worked on that do basic things, such as a sudoku game, 2D platformer, 2D procedural galaxy, snake game, quiz grade calculator, and more. 
Overall my goals for this github are to get my name out into the coding realm and create a location where I can safely and publicly share my code with others in order to help benefit them in some way.
